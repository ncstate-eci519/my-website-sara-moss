        The Basics
    </h2>
        <p>
            I currently live in Carrboro, NC. In December, I started a new job as a
            virtual teacher to an awesome group of kindergartners and first graders at an 
            online charter school in my home-state of Michigan called Uplift Michigan Online 
            School. Although I enjoyed teaching in traditional brick-and-mortar schools for 
            several years, I love teaching online.

    <h3>
       Hobbies
     </h3>
        <p> 
            My husband lovingly says I have a "hobby of making hobbies." This is definitely true in that 
            I like to learn a lot of different things. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are my current favorite hobbies:
        </p> 

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sewing-</strong>
                        After years of failing to figure out how to thread the bobbin on my 
                        sewing machine, I made it a goal during the pandemic to figure it out. 
                        I made a dress that was mostly wearable.
                </li>
                                    
                <li>
                    <strong>Furniture Restoration-</strong>
                        I love finding worn out pieces of Furniture at the thrift store or next 
                        to dumpsters and giving them new life.
                </li>

                                    
                <li>
                    <strong>Chess-</strong>
                        Like so many others during the pandemic, I watched <em>The Queen's Gambit</em> 
                        on Netflix an decided to learn to play chess.My husband had long been trying to 
                        teach me but I finally put in the effort and occassionally beat him!
                </li>

    <h2>
        My Favorite Educational Tech Tools
    </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Freckle Education</h3> 
                    <p>
                         I discovered Freckle Education when one of my favorite tools, <em>TenMarks</em> was retired. 
                         Freckle makes it easier for teachers to provide students with individualized learning. I love 
                         how easy it is to assign the same article content to all my students automatically based on 
                         their reading level. I also love that they are able to work at their own level by going through
                          the system's adaptive side. 
                     </p>
            </li>

            <li>        
                <h3>Google Suite</h3>
                    <p>
                        I contemplated whether I put Google on as a favorite tech tool since it is so integrated into many
                        people's lives already. However, since Google is part of my daily teaching life and my job comes a hault
                        anytime their services crash, I think it deserved a place on the list. I love the ways the Google Suite 
                        seemlessly integrates with my school's LMS, Buzz. Additionally, the tools available on the Google Suite 
                        make it a one-stop-shop for most of the things teachers and students need. 
                    </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Twine</h3>
                    <p>
                        I haven't used Twine with students yet because I teach littles. However, it seems like one of the coolest things!
                        On Twine, you can use basic coding skills to practice writing. Students can easily create make-your-own-adventure stories
                        as well as use the program to draft a paper and really see the various iterations. 
                    </p>
            </li>
             
            <li>
                <h3>EdPuzzle</h3>
                    <p>
                        I used EdPuzzle every week with my 3rd-5th graders. EdPuzzle is a tool that allows educators to insert voiceover as well 
                        as formative assessment questions throughout the video. Once assigned to students, they will go to EdPuzzle and watch the video.
                        EdPuzzle tracks their viewing as well as their answers to the questions. Students are not able to go to another tab or it will stop 
                        the video from playing. Students are able to rewatch the video in order to get the questions correct. Teachers can upload their own 
                        videos or they can choose videos from YouTube, Khan Academy, and more directly from the EdPuzzle video library.
